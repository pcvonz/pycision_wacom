#Setup 

This tool requires [xlib](https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib.git).

#Caveats

In the interest of getting straight into painting, I cut corners when
programming this. The future goal of this project is to have the user define
the area they want to toggle between, but that has yet to be implemented.
